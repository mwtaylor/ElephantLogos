# Colors

The standard elephant colors are #F4EDEB for the body and #3D3741 for the outline and eye. 

These can be changed when incorporating the elephant into a logo for another site with theme 
colors. The colors should always be very light and dark with only a slight tint of color. Never
make the body fill a bright vibrant color or dark color. The outline should always be a dark 
gray with a slight tint.
